1. Fizz Buzz REST Server
Description:
Fizz Buzz REST Server
Objective:
Implement a robust and production-ready Fizz-Buzz REST Server that follows the classic Fizz-Buzz logic. The server should expose a REST API endpoint, with the additional feature of a statistical endpoint.

Fizz-Buzz Logic
The Fizz-Buzz algorithm involves replacing all multiples of 3 with "fizz", all multiples of 5 with "buzz" and all multiples of 15 with "fizzbuzz". Your output should look like this:

Example: â€œ1,2,fizz,4,buzz,fizz,7,8,fizz,buzz,11,fizz,13,14,fizzbuzz,16,..."
Requirements
Your server should adhere to the following specifications:

1. REST API Endpoint
Accept five parameters: three integers (int1, int2, and limit) and two strings (str1 and str2).
Return a list of strings containing numbers from 1 to limit.
Replace multiples of int1 with str1, multiples of int2 with str2, and multiples of both int1 and int2 with str1str2
2. Production Ready
Ensure that the server is ready for production use.
Prioritize clean and maintainable code to facilitate future development by other developers.
3. Statistics Endpoint:
Add a statistics endpoint that accepts no parameters.
Return the parameters corresponding to the most used request.
Include the number of hits for the most frequent request.
4. Unit Tests:
Develop comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality of your server.
Submission:
 Once your server is ready, push the code to a public Git repository.
Include a README file that describes:
Special build instructions, if any
List of third-party libraries used and short description of why/how they were used
A link to the API documentation.
